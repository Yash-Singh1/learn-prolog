not operator self-study
----

The not operator is logical negation in prolog. It is a rule that negates
the value of its input. However, due to bad compatibility, it is best to
use the \+ operator instead. Logical negation in prolog is problematic
because the interpreter has to prove a statement to prove that it isn't true.
This can take infinite time because of logical loopholes and you have to be
careful when using logical negation.
